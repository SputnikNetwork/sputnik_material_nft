# sputnik_material_nft

This is a description of the material NFT, its composition, how it works and other useful information that may be useful to techno-magicians in the future to recreate the same or a similar artifact.

Every techno-mage should know that before casting any artifact, you need to prepare the primary elements: what the artifact will be created from.

The durability of the artifact will depend on the quality and purity of the primary elements, and the energy and thoughts invested by the magician during creation charges the artifact with the power of its impact on the material world.
